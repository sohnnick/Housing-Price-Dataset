# Kaggle Housing Price Dataset
Conducted exploratory analysis with Kaggle's Housing Price Dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.
As one of my first attempts at data science with Python, this experience enabled me to familiarize myself with Python libraries such as Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas.
Since this project, I have delved deeper into Machine Learning but I keep this in my GitHub to showcase my earliest work and how far I've gotten.
